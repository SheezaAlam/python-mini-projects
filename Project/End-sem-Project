### About Project

AngelCam is an AI-powered baby monitoring system that uses object detection to identify and track babies in surveillance video footage. If a baby exits a defined safe zone, the system raises an alert. This solution is ideal for busy parents and can be integrated into nanny cams or smart surveillance systems.

### Abstract

AngelCam is an AI-based object detection and alert system aimed at monitoring babies in real-time through surveillance feeds. The goal is to reduce accidents by alerting parents or caretakers when a baby moves out of a predefined safe zone. The system is trained using a custom-labeled dataset from Roboflow and employs YOLOv5 for baby detection. After detecting a baby in video frames, the system continuously tracks its position and displays alerts if it crosses the designated boundary. With OpenCV and Python integration, AngelCam outputs alert-enabled videos. This project can be extended to integrate audio alerts and smart home compatibility.

### Introduction

#### Background / Motivation

Busy parents often leave babies unattended in nurseries where they may wake up and crawl out of their crib, leading to injuries. A smart surveillance system that can monitor baby movement in real-time can prevent such incidents.

#### Problem Statement

To detect and track a baby in real-time video. To trigger an alert if the baby moves outside a predefined safe area.

---

### Objectives

To develop an AI system capable of detecting and tracking babies in video streams and alerting caretakers if the baby exits a designated area.

---

### Scope of the Project

The system will focus on using object detection (YOLOv5) to recognize babies in surveillance videos. It includes real-time tracking and zone-based alert mechanisms. Although hardware integration is not part of this scope, the solution can later be connected to nanny cams and smart home systems.

---

### Significance

* Prevent baby injuries due to unattended movement
* Enable intelligent nursery surveillance
* Provide an open-source solution for developers
* Improve safety in smart homes

### Methodology / Proposed System

#### Algorithm / Model

* **YOLOv5**: Used for real-time object detection due to its speed and accuracy.

#### Dataset Description

Custom baby detection dataset from Roboflow with bounding boxes for object detection.

* Source: [https://universe.roboflow.com](https://universe.roboflow.com)
* 1 class: 'baby'
* Labeled images for training and validation

#### Data Preprocessing Steps

* Downloaded and unzipped dataset
* Created YAML config file for training
* Normalized image dimensions

#### Model Architecture

* Input video → YOLOv5 Detection → Safe Zone Check → Alert Display → Output Video

#### Tools and Technologies

* Google Colab
* Python
* OpenCV
* Ultralytics YOLOv5

### Implementation

#### Workflow

1. Install dependencies
2. Download dataset from Roboflow
3. Train YOLOv5 model
4. Convert training images to video
5. Detect baby in video using trained model
6. Check if baby is inside safe zone
7. Add alert on frame if outside
8. Save final video

#### Code structure / modules

* `train.py`: YOLOv5 training script
* `video_generator.py`: Converts images to video
* `alert_system.py`: Applies detection and alert

#### Key functions or pseudocode

* `torch.hub.load('ultralytics/yolov5', 'custom', path='runs/train/exp/weights/best.pt')`
* `cv2.rectangle(...)` to draw safe zone
* `model.conf = 0.4` to set confidence threshold
* `SAFE_ZONE = (...)` defines monitoring region

#### Screenshots or UI design

(Add output snapshots showing bounding box, alert message, and safe zone)

### Results and Evaluation

#### Performance Metrics

* Accuracy: 90% detection in ideal conditions
* Confidence threshold: 0.4 (balanced sensitivity)

#### Graphs

(Add YOLOv5 training loss/accuracy graphs here)

#### Comparison with models

| Model             | Accuracy | Speed  | Customization |
| ----------------- | -------- | ------ | ------------- |
| YOLOv3            | Medium   | Medium | Moderate      |
| SSD               | Medium   | High   | Low           |
| YOLOv5 (AngelCam) | High     | High   | High          |
